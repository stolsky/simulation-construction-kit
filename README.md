# SiCK - Simulation Construction Kit
Toolbox to help you visualize your simulation ideas.

## Abstract
This library provides components and methods for executing and visualizing a simulation.

## Features
<!-- - [ ] feature x = to be implemented -->
- [ ] add more customizations to provided components
- [ ] renderer can be set globaly -> kind of MyDefaultRenderer = PixiJsRenderer
- [ ] any renderer can be implemented by using renderer interface class
- [ ] npm template(s) for creating new projects
- [ ] run simulation (a task may have specific number of iterations) for a specific number of times
- [ ] run simulation (a task may have specific number of iterations) for a specific timespan
- [ ] run a task for a specific timespan
- [x] run task endlessly
- [ ] run simulation endlessly
<!-- - [x] feature x = implemented -->
- [x] run 1 siteration (1 simulation cycle) as single or multiple (parallel) tasks
- [x] simple wrapper (IRenderer) interface for renderers
- [x] simple implementation of [pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) wrapper
- [x] simple controls component
- [x] simple visual/structural components
